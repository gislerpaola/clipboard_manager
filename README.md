# Clipboard Manager ðŸ“‹

A simple yet powerful menu bar utility for macOS that extends the system clipboard by allowing you to save and manage a history of copied items.

## Description

This application lives in your macOS menu bar and keeps a running list of text snippets that you choose to save. It's designed for anyone who frequently needs to reuse multiple pieces of text, such as code snippets, email templates, or common links. Your clipboard history is automatically saved to your computer, so your items will still be there even after a restart.

## Features

* **Persistent History**: Automatically saves your clipboard history to a local file, so your items are always available.
* **Unlimited History**: Save as many items as you need.
* **Menu Bar Access**: Easily access your saved items from the macOS menu bar.
* **One-Click Copy**: Simply click any item in the menu to copy it back to your system clipboard, ready to be pasted.
* **Selective Deletion**: Enter "Delete Mode" to safely remove specific items from your history one by one.
* **Clear All**: Instantly clear your entire clipboard history.
